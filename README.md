# Introduction
Leading armies in the ultimate formations. It is every general's dream. Ever wondered how the A.I. in several Real Time Strategy games work? 
Depending on how you would want them to act you have a few options for commanding large groups one for example is flocking.
But using flocking however is a bit too loose when you want to have a clear structure in your groups.

# How it is supposed to work (in my own version)
The way how I wanted to do it myself was a bit simplified. All units will pick out an offset when it comes to arriving to the spot. The units who are the furthest away from the clicked position will get to choose the offset which is closest to them. This way I can fill all of them in without them running into each other trying to walk to an obstructed path.

# Framework
I used the Unity framework and converted the steering behaviors from the Elite framework given by our school (Digital Arts and Entertainment: https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/) in our Gameplay Programming to fit the unity framework.
